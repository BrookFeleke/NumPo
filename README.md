# Number Position Game


<strong>Number-Position GAME</strong>

The rules are simple. There's a four digit number and your goal is to 
find it. You start by submitting your guess like 
you see here.


The game then tells you the amount of matching digits it has with the number you're supposed to find
and how many of those matching digits are in the correct position.The amount of 
correct digits is displayed on the first dark brown squares and the amount of 
correct positions is displayed on the second dark brown squares like so.



Here I guessed 1234 as my initial input and the game told me that two
of those four digits match the one that your supposed to find and out 
of those two only one is in the correct position. 

<strong>Note</strong>

. You can not input the same digits for when you're trying to submit a 
guess

. You have to input all four digits to be able to submit a guess 

. The number you have to find never has similar digits
